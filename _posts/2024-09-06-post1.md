Hello! I recently created this website, inspired by some of the amazing sites of fellow attendees at [Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/neuroscience/) Academy’s NeuroAI School 2024. After setting it up with an About section and social links, it felt a bit empty. So, I’m adding this “mini blog” section where I’ll share useful things I learn along my academic journey, tips for research, book/movie recommendations, and other interesting things.
Here we go…

One thing that has significantly improved my literature searches is using structured queries in Google and Google Scholar. In the past, I’d just throw all my keywords into a search bar, hoping for the best. But after discovering search operators, I can’t imagine searching without them. They’ve saved me countless hours, helping me quickly find relevant publications without sifting through irrelevant results or chasing down endless citation trails. Now, obviously, a lot of people already know this! But many of us don’t. This is especially true for undergrad students and interns. So this is for all of us folks who are just starting out.

What are search operators?
------

Search operators are symbols or words used in search engines to refine and target your search results. They help you narrow down results, making your searches faster and more effective.

The image above shows the operators I use most often, along with examples and explanations. It’s usually best to start with simple keywords and basic operators, then gradually refine your search to get more precise results.
I hear you thinking “It’s all very cool and all, but is it really going to be useful enough to make the exercise worth it?”. Believe me, It Does! In the beginning, while you are trying to get the hang of it, it might seem like it’s worse than simply using the keywords, but you will be thankful for knowing this when you are trying to frantically find that one reference you need to cite in support of a statement, or quickly sift through literature while preparing for Journal Club.
Here are some queries I have used recently while preparing applications for PhD positions:
1.	{% raw %} ("perineuronal nets" | tenascin) AND astrocytes AND (ion channels) -microglia –review {% endraw %}
2.	{% raw %} (RNAseq | scRNAseq) AND Parkinson's AND (primate | human) AND (nigra | mid*brain) –review {% endraw %}
3.	{% raw %} LUHMES AND (organoids OR (3D culture)) AND astrocytes AND electrophysiology –review {% endraw %}
Hope this comes of use to you all sometime. Thanks for reading, and I would love to connect with you all over [twitter](https://x.com/js_neuro) or [email](mailto:jyotirmaysrivastava.in@gmail.com)!
