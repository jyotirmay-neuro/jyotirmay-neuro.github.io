Hi! Iâ€™m Jyotirmay Srivastava, a recent post-graduate and researcher dedicated to sudying the mysteries of the brain, from the molecular to systems level. With a foundation in neurobiology and a passion for both experimental and computational techniques, I aim to advance our fundamental understanding of how the brain functions. Currently, **I am looking for PhD positions where I can continue to explore these fascinating questions.**

Academic Journey So Far..
======
My research journey began at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram, where I first started working in Thakur Neurodegeneration Lab. This experience laid the groundwork for my skills and knowledge of neurobiology and experimental research. I worked with a chronic mouse model of Parkinson's Disease to study neurodegeneration and evaluate the therapeutic potential of autophagy modulators. Along the way, I gained experience with various techniques and working with mice.

In addition to my experimental skills, I integrated my love for computer science into my research. I taught myself machine learning techniques and developed a GUI-enabled tool for automating the cylinder test used to estimate unilateral degenerative pathology. This combination of experimental and computational approaches is a hallmark of my research philosophy, which I hope will enable me to not only generate high-quality data but also extract detailed insights that might otherwise be overlooked.

My Philosophy
======
My approach to research is guided by the core principles of curiosity and collaboration. I believe that the most significant scientific discoveries come from a deep sense of curiosity and pursuit for understanding anything and everything. This drives me to explore the fundamental mechanisms of the brain, from how it encodes and decodes information, to how it integrates sensory and motor signals to perform precise and elegant actions, to how it generates vivid imaginations.

When faced with challenges, I find it essential to step back and clear my mind, which often provides a fresh perspective and helps break free from the inevitable loops of the same ideas the I know won't work. And nothing beats the effectiveness of revisiting the basics and understanding the fundamentals when dealing with failed experiments and protocols. Going to the internet and searching for literature and forum discussionions is probably the single biggest advantage of widespread internet access. If I run into a problem, probably someone, somewhere, would have had it too and might have a solution. It's better to learn from them instead of reinventing the wheel.

Collaboration is at the heart of my work. I enjoy working with colleagues, sharing knowledge, and learning from others. Helping my peers not only brings me joy but also provides a much-needed break from my own work, and has often lead to new ideas and solutions to the problem I may have been stuck at. So it's hitting two birds with one stone, taking a break from work to clear my head and helping a colleague solve their problem. Mentoring is another part of my approach and I strive to pass on the invaluable guidance I received to interns and junior colleagues. Teaching fundamentals and encouraging critical thinking not only helps them grow but also strengthens my understanding and skills. Not to forget, that the juniors bring in fresh ideas and perspectives, often asking questions i haven't considered before, that lead to deeper insights.


**Always happy connect with others. Let's have deep discussions about the mysteries of this universe...**
